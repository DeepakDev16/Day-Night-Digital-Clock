The Day–Night Digital Clock is an interactive and visually stunning web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It dynamically displays the current time while offering a day and night mode that automatically or manually transitions between bright morning skies and serene night scenes.

With smooth animations, realistic sun and moon motion, glowing neon clock effects, and atmospheric background elements like clouds, stars, and shooting stars, this project beautifully blends functionality with aesthetic design.

It also provides dynamic greetings (Good Morning, Good Evening, etc.) based on the current time, enhancing user experience and engagement.
